2)Pandas Methods which are used in these project-: *info(),desribe(),isna(),sum() *drop(),fillna() *value_counts(),groupby(),nlargest() *nunique(),max(),min()

3)Graph which are used-: 

->For plotting i have used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn

Bar graph
Pie chart
Heat map

4)Workdone-:

*By using pandas drop method i have drop all the columns which are not needed in our analysis which contains huge amount of missing values and filled the Basepay column by fillna method.

*I manually created a Exp function and applyied it on our dataset to compare with TotalPayBenefits.

*I used mean to get the average BasePay.

*I used max() and min() to get the maximum value and minimum value with respect to columns.

*I used nunique to count the number of unique Job title.

*I used groupby where i need the reference of some other column.

*I used nlargest method to know top values to understand clearly.


5)Conclusion-:

->The Correlation between Basepay,Totalpay and TotalPayBenefits because Basepay is the part of Totalpay and Totalpay is the part of Totalpaybenefits.

->In actual Exp and Totalpaybenefits have high correlation i.e if experience is more than Totalpaybenefits will be more but this is the fake data so that the correlation is is -   ve or almost zero which means as Experience increases totalpaybenefits decreases or viz.

->The Avearge Basepay of the Employee gets from the institue or company provides range from is 63000 to 67000,from the year from 2011 to 2014.

->Maximum Overtimepay is 245131.88.

->NATHANIEL FORD is the highest paid person and works as a General Manager in Metropolitan Transit Autority.

->Joe Lopez is the lowest paid person and he works as Councelor in Log Cabin Ranch.

->There are 2159 unique jobs in our dataset and Transit Operator has highest number of Job posts.

->477 people have chief in their Jobtitle,Employee name is Yvonne R Mere and he gets 319275.01,is the highest basepay who contains chief in the jobtitle.

6)RESULT-:

->From the conclusion i suggest the jobseekers that they must be well educated and eligible to apply in high responsible post such general manager,chief etc in their relevant     department so they can get high pay benefits.

->There are 2159 unique jobs when department opens a vaccancy there must be a chance that atleast 2159 can get the job.

->If they get placed in the relevant department i suggest the emplooyer do not take any loan from their department as my analysis i can see that they are deducting whole salary   in some cases that means dept/institute do not have any rules and regulation for recovery in that situation employeer can be in trouble or else try to request that they must     come up with the proper rules and regulation for recovery.
